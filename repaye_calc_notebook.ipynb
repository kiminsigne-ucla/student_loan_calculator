    "# Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) student loan calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will implement my own version of a student loan calculator, like this [exampe](https://studentloanhero.com/calculators/student-loan-revised-pay-as-you-earn-calculator/) from Studen Loan Hero. My fiance went to medical school at USC and took out full loans to cover his tuition and living expenses for four years. He has been on an income-based repayment plan during his two years in residency. We recently learned that it's very disadvantageous for us to be legally married, as my income is automatically combined with his and his monthly loan payments would greatly increase. I wanted to run the numbers myself, in an interactive and visual way. This is what I came up with!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disclaimer**: This should in no way be taken as financial advice or be taken to be completely accurate. We still plan on consulting with a tax professional on all of this, but I just wanted to code this up myself for my own peace of mind and to get a rough idea of the numbers."

If your monthly income payments do not cover the interest, the government will give you 50% of the remaining unpaid interest. The other 50% of unpaid interest **is not accrued**. This results in your overall loan balance remaining static while your monthly payments cannot cover the interest. Your payments aren't going towards the principal, but at least your overall loan amount does not increase. This is really helpful during residency is your loans are particularly massive.\n",

    "From the table above, you can see that the interest subsidy really pays off for us. My partner does not make enough in annual payments to cover the interest for *six years*. Although he's making payments that don't touch the principal, it's really nice that interest doesn't keep adding up thanks to the subsidy. You can also see how over the first six years the interest subsidy keeps decreasing until he makes enough money to cover the interest payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monthly payments ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the monthly payments nearly double over 20 years, it's still less than the monthly payment under the standard plan (code still in progress, but its ~$4,700/month).\n",
    "\n",
    "### In progress ###\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to add functionality that will calculate how much more you pay with REPAYE vs. standard loan, and which one makes better financial sense, including the tax bomb. I've run the numbers by hand, including the tax bomb, and you pay ~\\$48,000 more under the REPAYE plan compared to standard (\\$548K vs \\$590K), although it's spread out over ten more years. The tax bomb for REPAYE on \\$257K forgiven is ~\\$130K, based on his income growth after 20 years and the California Income tax calculator (with and without the tax bomb). One thing to consider is that the burden of this bill will be eased with inflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Final verdict ###\n",
    "\n",
    "I was pleasantly surprised to see that the difference in the total amount paid on the loan between REPAYE vs. standard wasn't too big, roughly one extra year of paying on the standard plan. While it's a lot to save up for the tax bomb, the saving is spread out over 20 years and the impact is reduced with inflation (i.e. it's easier to pay that off with future dollars). Finally, although we aren't planning on this, the tax bomb could be changed with legislation. Many students signed on to these types of plans within the past few years, so there is some years before millions of people will have to pay up for this loan forgiveness. \n",
    "\n",
    "We personally think that the tax bomb is worth it in order to enjoy our money while we're younger, for things like buying a house. The standard monthly payment is such a high percentage of his monthly income, almost 40%, and he could theoretically pay off the loan aggressively over the next five or so years. While the choice is very personal and depends on your own financial philosophy and circumstance, planning ahead for the loan forgiveness seems to be the smartest choice for us both financially and for our happiness!"
