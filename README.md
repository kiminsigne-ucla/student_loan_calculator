This is a simple little student loan calculator I created for myself. Please
read `repaye_calc_notebook.ipynb` for a full walkthrough of the code. The bokeh output
doesn't render properly in HTML, so I've included a screen shot of the final results.
If you download the .ipynb file and open in Jupyter, it'll be interactive. I've also
included the python script, which will have full interactivity in the browser if you
have Bokeh installed. You can serve the app with:

`bokeh serve --show repay_calc_bokeh.py`

and it will open a new browser window that has true functionality. Thanks for checking this out!
