This is a simple little student loan calculator I created for myself. Please
read `repaye_calc_notebook.ipynb` for a full walkthrough of the code. It's a little
tricky to capture true interactivity through an ipython notebook on Github, so
I've also included the python script. If you have install Bokeh, you can serve the app with:

`bokeh serve --show repay_calc_bokeh.py`

and it will open a new browser window that has true functionality. Thanks for checking this out!
